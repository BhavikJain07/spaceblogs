## Inspiration
We got the inspiration to this project from [Medium](https://medium.com/). We wanted to create a space for all those who gaze upon the stars. 
## What it does
Space Blogs gives its users the latest and greatest news from multiple sources about space. We are not stopping the users from sharing thier ideas, which is why we have added the blogs feature where users can write thier own articles and can publish them on the very same site. Each article goes through a detailed inspection by a team of experts to avoid any misinformation.
## How we built it
We built this application using multiple technologies including ReactJS, Flask, Firebase aka Google Cloud, NewsAPI etc. The look and feel of this application is made with ReactJS, Flask does the heavy lifting, while Firebase aka Google Cloud handle our users and secures our data.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into multiple challenges while building this website. Some of them were time constraints, quality ensurement and performance.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are so proud to accomplish the completion of this project and we are also proud to have tackled all the challenges.
## What we learned
We learnt a lot from this project, and this hackathon in general. This has given us oppurtunity to work on something we have never done before like merging a react application with flask etc.
## What's next for Space Blogs
The next step for space blogs is to make it more robust. Migrate it from the testing db and servers to a production grade environment, and yes more fun features are on thier way..........
